[GigPress](http://gigpress.com) is a live performance listing and management plugin that's been serving musicians and performers since 2007, when I "learned" PHP in order to write it. This shows in the procedural mess that is the code.

Lack of available time and my decreasing use of WordPress have led me to neglect the poor thing in recent years. Perhaps some brave souls here in GitHub-land who are still avid users will endeavour to improve it.

The plugin is hosted on WordPress' plugin repository, which is a Subversion repo, so I'll be damned if I have nay idea how I'll get changes made here migrated back to there, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it I suppose.
